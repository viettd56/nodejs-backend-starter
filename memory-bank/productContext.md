## User Domain Design Overview

The user domain is structured into three main layers:

- **Entity Layer:** [`UserEntity`](src/domains/user/user.entity.ts:10) encapsulates user data and related logic.
- **Repository Layer:** [`userRepository`](src/domains/user/user.repository.ts:79) handles data persistence and retrieval using the entity.
- **Service Layer:** [`userService`](src/domains/user/user.service.ts:73) implements business logic and orchestrates repository operations.

- [`UserService`](src/domains/user/user.service.ts:73) creates and manages users, and generates tokens via [`TokenService`](src/domains/token/token.service.ts).
- [`UserRepository`](src/domains/user/user.repository.ts:79) persists and retrieves user data, converting between models and entities.
- [`UserEntity`](src/domains/user/user.entity.ts:10) represents the user domain object.
